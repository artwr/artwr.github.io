Research Experience
===================

**University of California – Berkeley**, Berkeley,
California USA\
*Graduate Student*\
Includes current Ph.D. research, Ph.D. and Masters level coursework and
research projects.

**Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory**, Berkeley,
California USA\
*Graduate Student Research Assistant*\
As part of the [ASCEM
project](http://esd.lbl.gov/research/projects/ascem/) data management
team in the Computational Research Division, I used site and field
knowledge to ingest heterogeneous data sources (Oracle DB, Access DB,
flat files in various formats) and help develop the schema for a MS SQL
Server database with GIS capabilities, transforming the data for a
PostgreSQL instance serving as a backend for visualization in the
browser.

**Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory**, Berkeley,
California USA\
*Guest Graduate Student Researcher*\
Collected and extracted data from archives and interpreted them, leading
to a better understanding of the contamination history and transport
processes at the site of study (Savannah River Site). Based on this I
created visualizations (MATLAB, R) used as a support for conceptual
understanding by research teams at the Earth Science Division.

**California Center for Innovative Transportation**,
Berkeley, CA\
*Research Assistant/Junior Programmer*\
Carried out several programming and visualization projects, ranging from
creating animated movies from GPS logs using Google Earth, Python, and
ffmpeg to using Java to compute statistics on travel times for the
MITTENS system displaying messages on Changeable Message Signs in the
Bay Area.

**Supagro Montpellier**, Montpellier, France\
*Research Assistant*\
Carried out measurement campaigns and lab experiments on the growth of
freshwater algae in irrigation channels. Compiled a review of population
dynamics models with applications to the environmental conditions.

Teaching Experience
===================

**University of California – Berkeley**, Berkeley,
California USA\
Classes were taught in the Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)
Department unless noted otherwise. I was a Graduate Student Instructor
(GSI), Berkeley’s title for Teaching Assistants.\

**Graduate Level**\
Environmental Physical-Chemical Processes\
Led class discussions including lab demos, provided feedback on the
content for the new version of the class, graded exams.\

**Undergraduate Level**\
Introduction to Hydrology\
Led class discussions and additional workshops on Differential
Equations, Statistics, MATLAB. Produced original materials for sections
and exams. Conducted two full lectures on statistical modelling in
Hydrology.\

Introductory Physics, Physics department\
Managed two discussion and lab sections per week and provided additional
tutoring to students in difficulty.\

Introduction to Hydrology\
Led class discussions (30-50 students), provided original materials for
review sessions\

**Tutoring**\
Peer and undergrad tutoring at Berkeley on engineering and science
fundamentals including : Differential Equations, Fluid Mechanics, Fate
and Transport, Statistics, Linear Models, Uncertainty Quantification.\
